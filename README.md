## DATE: 
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.

## OUTPUT:
# Step 1

# Explanation:
In the FDM 3D printing process, STEP 1 instructs users to click on 'Base' in the software interface. This action reveals settings for foundational aspects like layer adhesion. Subsequently, information related to both 'Base' and 'Build Platform' is displayed on the left side of the screen, aiding in configuring essential print parameters.

# Explanation:
In the FDM 3D printing process, STEP 2 guides users to click on 'Extruder' within the software interface. This action reveals settings for the extrusion system. Subsequently, details pertaining to both the 'Extruder' and 'Extruder Nozzle' are displayed. Users can then fine-tune parameters related to filament extrusion and nozzle characteristics, essential for achieving precise layer deposition and optimizing the FDM printing process.

# Explanation:

In the FDM 3D printing process, STEP 3 directs users to click on 'Material Spool' in the software interface. This prompts the display of information related to the material spool, including details such as filament type, color, and remaining quantity. Users can then manage and monitor filament usage, ensuring a seamless printing experience. Configuring the 'Material Spool' settings is crucial for selecting and optimizing material properties throughout the FDM printing process.

#Explanation:
In the FDM 3D printing process, selecting 'Filament' prompts users to manage filament-related settings. This step allows users to add, load, or specify details about the filament being used, such as type, color, and diameter. Configuring the 'Filament' ensures proper feeding and adherence during the printing process, contributing to the overall quality and success of the FDM 3D print.

# Explanation:
In the FDM 3D printing process, after configuring settings for 'Base,' 'Extruder,' and 'Material Spool,' users are instructed to click on 'Start Process' within the software interface. This action initiates the printing sequence, causing the 3D printer to execute the configured parameters. It marks the beginning of the FDM process, where the printer progressively builds the object layer by layer using the specified settings.

# Explanation:
Once the FDM 3D printing process concludes, users are instructed to click on 'Stop Process' within the software interface. This action halts the printer and enables users to examine the completed product. Clicking 'Stop Process' ensures a controlled end to the FDM print job, allowing for inspection and retrieval of the finalized 3D printed object with precision and convenience.
